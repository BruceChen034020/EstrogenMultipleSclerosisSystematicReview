AB  -  Background: For women with multiple sclerosis (MS), the menopausal transition can result in overlapping symptoms, worsening disability progression, and reduced quality of life. Observational data suggest that hormone therapy may improve physical functioning in these women. Objectives: To conduct a Phase II randomized controlled clinical trial comparing a tissue‐selective estrogen complex (Duavee®, bazedoxifene 20mg + conjugated estrogen 0.45 mg daily) vs. placebo in women with MS. Methods: We randomized 24 (peri)menopausal women with MS and excessive hot flashes 1:1 to Duavee vs. placebo. Clinical evaluations occurred at baseline and 2 months; a subset of 12 participants underwent brain MRI at both timepoints. Due to the planned low sample size, our pre‐specified power calculation was based on a “play the winner” approach, with 80% power to observe a greater mean change in the treatment than in the control arm. Results: At baseline, the groups were similar in demographic and clinical features, including age (mean 51.2 + 3.6 years), MS duration (median 10 (1, 32) years), EDSS (median 3 (1.5, 7)), Timed 25 Foot Walk, degree of cognitive impairment (SDMT), and MS treatment. Study retention was high, with 21/24 women completing the study. The treatment was well tolerated. Women in the treatment arm reported greater median Global Satisfaction on the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication and fewer missed medication doses. Only one participant, in the placebo arm, developed new interval T2 lesions or gadolinium enhancing lesions in those receiving MRIs. The treatment group reported a greater change in EDSS severity (a median decrease of 0.5 (‐1.5, 1), compared to no decrease in the placebo group 0 (‐1.5, 1) and fewer menopausal symptoms at study's end, as measured by the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale: 4 (0, 37) vs. 9 (0, 57). All women in the treatment group vs. 5/8 in the placebo group experienced decreased daily and nightly hot flashes. None of these differences were significant, likely due to our small sample size, and are reported descriptively only. Conclusions: In this pilot study, we demonstrate feasibility of conducting a trial targeting menopausal symptoms in women with MS. Although retention, treatment satisfaction, hot flash and EDSS reduction all favored the treatment group, we had insufficient power to assess statistical significance. However, our encouraging results support an adequately powered trial assessing the efficacy of hormonal therapy for vasomotor symptoms.

AB  -  OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the effects of different hormone therapies on cardiac repolarization in recently postmenopausal women with and without hot flashes. METHODS: We recruited 150 healthy women: 72 with and 78 without hot flashes. They were randomized and treated for 6 months with transdermal estradiol (1 mg/day), oral estradiol (OE) alone (2 mg/day) or combined with medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA; 5 mg/day), or placebo. Cardiac repolarization was assessed by measuring QT intervals, rate‐dependence of QT‐end interval, and T waves from 24‐hour electrocardiographic recording before and during hormone therapy, comprising a total of over 20 million QT‐interval measurements. RESULTS: Hot flashes were accompanied with shortened median T‐peak ‐ T‐end interval (at RR interval of 700, 800, and 900 ms; P = 0.040, 0.020, and 0.032; η = 0.35, 0.39, and 0.37; respectively) during the use of OE but not transdermal estradiol. In contrast, the addition of MPA to OE lengthened the maximal QT‐end (at RR interval of 500 ms, P = 0.016, η = 0.27) and the maximal T‐peak ‐ T‐end interval (at RR interval of 500 and 600 ms; P = 0.016 and 0.032; η = 0.25 and 0.22, respectively). These effects were not seen in women without hot flashes. CONCLUSIONS: Hot flashes predict beneficial shortening in cardiac repolarization during OE, but not if MPA is combined with OE. These data may provide one explanation for MPA‐related cardiac hazards in epidemiological studies.

AB  -  INTRODUCTION: Most women develop MS before menopause. Menopausal hot flashes can worsen MS symptoms, and could be relieved with hormone therapy. Our objective was to evaluate feasibility, tolerability and symptom response of Duavee® (bazedoxifene + conjugated estrogen) in a Phase Ib/IIa double‐blind randomized controlled clinical trial. METHODS: We randomized 24 peri/postmenopausal women with MS and symptomatic hot flashes 1:1 to Duavee® versus placebo. Evaluations occurred at baseline and 2 months. RESULTS: Groups were balanced for age (mean 51.2 ± 3.6 years), EDSS [median 3 (IQR:2.5, 4.5)], and MS duration. 21/24 participants completed the study. FEASIBILITY: Enrollment was protracted (34 months), partially due to concerns about hormone therapy safety. TOLERABILITY: treatment group participants reported greater satisfaction and fewer missed doses; one participant (placebo) developed new MRI lesions; liver function testing remained normal for all patients. SYMPTOMS: Hot Flash Related Daily Interference scale at 2 months was lower in treatment vs. placebo group [median (IQR) of 4 (0.5, 14) vs. 9 (0, 33)]. Between‐group differences were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Despite perceived benefits in MS, estrogens have perceived risks that represent a hurdle to enrollment. With appropriate education and screening of participants, the favorable study retention (87%) and treatment satisfaction observed in the current study support the feasibility of a longer, powered trial to evaluate whether a proven treatment for menopausal symptoms, Duavee®, could also improve MS‐related function in menopausal women with MS.

AB  -  OBJECTIVE: Based on the hypothesis that high‐meat diets may increase breast cancer risk through hormonal pathways, the present analysis compared oestrogens in serum and urine by meat‐eating status. DESIGN: Intervention with repeated measures. SETTING: Two randomized soya trials (BEAN1 and BEAN2) among premenopausal healthy women. SUBJECTS: BEAN1 participants completed seven unannounced 24 h dietary recalls and donated five blood and urine samples over 2 years. BEAN2 women provided seven recalls and three samples over 13 months. Serum samples were analysed for oestrone (E₁) and oestradiol (E₂) using RIA. Nine oestrogen metabolites were measured in urine by LC‐MS. Semi‐vegetarians included women who reported consuming <30 g of red meat, poultry and fish daily, and pescatarians those who reported consuming <20 g of meat/poultry but >10 g of fish daily. All other women were classified as non‐vegetarians. We applied mixed models to compute least‐square means by vegetarian status adjusted for potential confounders. RESULTS: The mean age of the 272 participants was 41·9 (SD 4·5) years. Serum E₁ (85 v. 100 pg/ml, P = 0·04) and E₂ (140 v. 154 pg/ml, P = 0·04) levels were lower in the thirty‐seven semi‐vegetarians than in the 235 non‐vegetarians. The sum of the nine urinary oestrogen metabolites (183 v. 200 pmol/mg creatinine, P = 0·27) and the proportions of individual oestrogens and pathways did not differ by meat‐eating status. Restricting the models to the samples collected during the luteal phase strengthened the associations. CONCLUSIONS: Given the limitations of the study, the lower levels of serum oestrogens in semi‐vegetarians than non‐vegetarians need confirmation in larger populations.

AB  -  The aim of our study was to compare the responses of heart rate variability (HRV) with two different types of hormonal substitution therapy (HT) in post‐menopausal women (cross‐sectional study) and to reveal an effect of HT shortly after beginning of its administration (follow‐up study). To elucidate the influence of menopause and effects of different protocols of a HT on autonomic control of heart rate, we evaluated the heart rate variability (HRV) in 5 groups: premenopausal women (n=140), postmenopausal women without HT (n=360), women on HT with conjugated estrogen only (n=168), women on continuous combined estrogen‐progesterone HT (n=117), and men (n=140). Frequency‐domain of short‐term stationary R‐R intervals was performed to evaluate the total variance, low frequency power (LF; 0.04‐0.15 Hz), high frequency power (HF; 0.15‐0.40 Hz), portion of low frequency power (LF%) and ratio of LF to HF (LF/HF). Significantly lower portion of the LF was found in premenopausal women [46.9 (+/‐2.7) nu] when compared to untreated postmenopausal women [54.3 (+/‐2.9) nu] and men [55.2 (+/‐3.0) nu]. Treatment by estrogen only was proved to decrease the LF% [40.1 (+/‐2.1) nu] while no effect on HRV was observed in women treated with combination of estrogen and progesterone [57.2 (+/‐3.1) nu]. Also the HF was lower in postmenopausal women [4.16 (+/‐0.16) ms(2)] than in premenopausal women [4.79 (+/‐0.22) ms(2)] and women treated with estrogen only [4.98 (+/‐0.25) ms(2)] while in women treated with combined hormonal therapy the average value [3.99 (+/‐0.21) ms(2)] did not significantly differ from that of untreated postmenopausal women. The follow‐up study also proved increase of high frequency power already after two months of estrogen substitution therapy [4.86 (+/‐0.14) ms(2) vs. 4.19 (+/‐0.15) ms(2)]. These results suggest that higher vagal modulation of heart rate that seems typical for younger women becomes after menopause similar to that of men. We also proved a positive shift of HRV parameters toward more beneficial values as for a cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women treated with estrogens but not in those treated by combined estrogen ‐ progesterone substitution therapy.

AB  -  Background: Estrogen therapy in early menopausal women decreases the risk of coronary heart disease and parenteral, but not oral, estrogen is reported to reduce blood pressure (BP). Progestogens are typically added to estrogens to prevent unopposed endometrial stimulation. The effects of progestogen on BP have been less well studied to date. This study was conducted to explore the impacts of micronized progesterone (MP4) combined with percutaneous estradiol gel (PEG) on hemodynamics in postmenopausal Korean women with grade 1 hypertension. Methods: Fifty‐two postmenopausal women (aged 49–75 years) with systolic BP (SBP) of 140–160 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) of 90–100 mmHg were randomly assigned for 12 weeks to placebo (n = 16), estrogen therapy (ET) (n = 19) with PEG (0.1 %, 1 g./d), or estrogen + progestogen therapy (EPT, n = 17) with PEG and MP4 (100 mg/d). The primary endpoint was ambulatory BP and the secondary endpoints were arterial stiffness as brachial–ankle pulse‐wave velocity (baPWV) and aortic parameters on applanation tonometry. Results: One woman in the ET group dropped out, so 51 participants were finally analyzed. Outcome measures for ambulatory BP and arterial stiffness were not different between groups. Within‐group comparisons showed that EPT significantly decreased daytime heart rate and baPWV: the changes from baseline (mean ± standard deviation) were − 2.5 ± 5.7 bpm (P = 0.03) and − 0.6 ± 1.4 m/s (P = 0.04), respectively. After adjusting for baseline, linear regression analysis revealed a significant difference in the relationship between baseline and 12‐week baPWV among groups (P = 0.02). The relationship was significantly different between placebo and ET (P = 0.03) and EPT (P = 0.01), respectively, but not between ET and EPT. Additionally, pooled results of active treatments disclosed that SBP, DBP, PWV, and augmentation index at the aorta were significantly reduced relative to baseline. Conclusions: There was no difference in ambulatory BP between ET and EPT in postmenopausal Korean women with grade 1 hypertension. Further, ET and EPT similarly decreased baPWV from baseline as compared with placebo. MP4 might not adversely influence estrogen effects on ambulatory BP and arterial stiffness.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Estrogen therapy in early menopausal women decreases the risk of coronary heart disease and parenteral, but not oral, estrogen is reported to reduce blood pressure (BP). Progestogens are typically added to estrogens to prevent unopposed endometrial stimulation. The effects of progestogen on BP have been less well studied to date. This study was conducted to explore the impacts of micronized progesterone (MP4) combined with percutaneous estradiol gel (PEG) on hemodynamics in postmenopausal Korean women with grade 1 hypertension. METHODS: Fifty‐two postmenopausal women (aged 49‐75 years) with systolic BP (SBP) of 140‐160 mmHg or diastolic BP (DBP) of 90‐100 mmHg were randomly assigned for 12 weeks to placebo (n = 16), estrogen therapy (ET) (n = 19) with PEG (0.1 %, 1 g./d), or estrogen + progestogen therapy (EPT, n = 17) with PEG and MP4 (100 mg/d). The primary endpoint was ambulatory BP and the secondary endpoints were arterial stiffness as brachial‐ankle pulse‐wave velocity (baPWV) and aortic parameters on applanation tonometry. RESULTS: One woman in the ET group dropped out, so 51 participants were finally analyzed. Outcome measures for ambulatory BP and arterial stiffness were not different between groups. Within‐group comparisons showed that EPT significantly decreased daytime heart rate and baPWV: the changes from baseline (mean ± standard deviation) were ‐ 2.5 ± 5.7 bpm (P = 0.03) and ‐ 0.6 ± 1.4 m/s (P = 0.04), respectively. After adjusting for baseline, linear regression analysis revealed a significant difference in the relationship between baseline and 12‐week baPWV among groups (P = 0.02). The relationship was significantly different between placebo and ET (P = 0.03) and EPT (P = 0.01), respectively, but not between ET and EPT. Additionally, pooled results of active treatments disclosed that SBP, DBP, PWV, and augmentation index at the aorta were significantly reduced relative to baseline. CONCLUSIONS: There was no difference in ambulatory BP between ET and EPT in postmenopausal Korean women with grade 1 hypertension. Further, ET and EPT similarly decreased baPWV from baseline as compared with placebo. MP4 might not adversely influence estrogen effects on ambulatory BP and arterial stiffness.

AB  -  Background: This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the only direct head‐to‐head comparison of letrozole and exemestane concerning suppression of serum estrogen levels in postmenopausal breast cancer patients. Methods: In this cross‐over design study, 102 breast cancer patients were randomized into two cohorts for neoadjuvant endocrine therapy. Cohort 1 initially received letrozole (2.5 mg daily) for 3 months, then switched to exemestane (25 mg daily) for another 3 months. Cohort 2, conversely, started with exemestane and then switched to letrozole. Serum levels of estrone, estradiol, letrozole, and exemestane were measured using an ultrasensitive LC‐MS/MS assay. This enabled precise monitoring of drug efficacy, and provided invaluable quality control for drug adherence, a known challenge in endocrine therapy, ensuring accurate assessment of the therapeutic comparison. Results: Letrozole achieved superior suppression of serum estrogen levels compared to exemestane. In Cohort 1, which started with letrozole, estrone and estradiol levels significantly decreased from baseline to 0.2 pmol/L and 0.4 pmol/L, respectively, but increased after switching to exemestane. Conversely, in Cohort 2, which began with exemestane, letrozole further reduced estrogen levels upon cross‐over. Notably, while on letrozole, 94% of patients had estrone levels below the quantification limit, compared to only 35% when on exemestane. Serum drug levels confirmed treatment adherence and were correlated with the degree of estrogen suppression. Conclusions: This study conclusively demonstrates letrozole's superior efficacy in suppressing serum estrogens compared to exemestane during neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment. The findings indicate that the well‐documented lack of cross‐resistance between these drugs in clinical settings, allowing sequential therapy in MBC, is likely due to mechanisms beyond estrogen suppression. Our research group is currently investigating several additional, hithero unknown anti‐tumor effects during exemestane therapy. In the long run, our results may improve the selection of individual patients to the different types of aromatase inhibitors.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: In ovulating psychiatric patients experiencing suicidality, suicidal ideation (SI) often peaks perimenstrually. Our recent double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover randomized clinical trial (RCT; NCT03720847) showed that perimenstrual administration of estradiol and progesterone (EP) can prevent this peak in SI and depressed mood. In this pre‐registered follow‐up analysis, we studied how the menstrual cycle and experimental manipulation affected two neurobiological systems associated with the menstrual cycle and suicide risk: GABAergic neuroactive steroids (NAS) and peripheral cytokines. METHODS: In 26 psychiatric outpatients with natural menstrual cycles and past‐month SI, we analyzed serum samples from three blood draws (midluteal, perimenstrual, midfollicular) per experimental condition (EP vs placebo) timed to a luteinizing hormone‐surge ovulation test. Using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), we measured the progesterone (P4)‐derived pregnane NAS (3α,5α)‐ 3‐hydroxypregnan20‐one (3α,5α‐THP), (3α,5β)‐ 3‐hydroxypregnan‐20‐one (3α,5β‐THP), (3α,5α)‐ 3,21‐dihydroxypregnan‐20‐one (3α,5α‐THDOC), (3α,5α)‐ 3‐hydroxyandrostan‐17‐one (3α,5α‐A), the androstane NAS (3α,5β)‐ 3‐hydroxyandrostan‐17‐one (3α,5β‐A), (3α,5α,17β)‐androstane‐3,17‐diol (3α,5α‐A‐diol), (3α,5β,17β)‐androstane‐3,17‐diol (3α,5β‐A‐diol), and their precursor pregnenolone. High sensitivity multiplex assay kits quantified peripheral cytokines IL‐1β, IL‐6, and TNF‐α. RESULTS: P4‐derived NAS fluctuated in parallel with P4 and increased with exogenous perimenstrual administration of EP. Conversely, androstane NAS either did not fluctuate or fluctuated inversely from P4, and these NAS decreased with exogenous EP. Peripheral cytokines did not show cyclical patterns, but each significantly predicted SI, depressed mood, or anxiousness. Concomitant SSRI medication use predicted lower androstane NAS. CONCLUSIONS: While preliminary and exploratory, our findings provide critical descriptive context for future studies. Further, our work presents menstrual cycle‐related patterns for ten frequently‐studied biomarkers, allowing for improved quality of comparisons involving naturally‐cycling populations in research.

AB  -  Background: Three aromatase inhibitors (AI), the steroid exemestane, and the azoles anastrozole and letrozole, are effective in the treatment of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer by preventing biosynthesis of estrogens including estradiol (E2), estrone (E1), and estrone‐sulfate (E1S) in postmenopausal women. OATP1B1, encoded by SLCO1B1, transports E1S into the liver for desulfation to active E1. Women carrying the low‐expression SLCO1B1 rs4149056 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) have higher E1‐conjugate levels (Dudenkov Breast Cancer Res Treat 2017). We hypothesized that patients carrying this SNP would have increased E1S at baseline, and this E1S reserve could resupply E1 and E2 resulting in detectable estrogen levels during AI treatment. Methods: Five hundred postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer were randomized 1:1 to either exemestane 25 mg/day or letrozole 2.5 mg/day. Plasma estrogen concentrations were measured prior to and after 3 months of AI treatment using LC/MS/MS (LLOQ for E2 = 0.625 pg/mL, E1 = 1.56 pg/mL, E1S = 3.13 pg/mL). The additive genetic associations between rs4149056 and 1) log‐transformed concentrations of E2, E1, and E1S at baseline and 2) detectable ( > LLOQ) concentrations of E2, E1, and E1S after 3 months of AI treatment, were tested using linear and logistic regression, respectively. Results: Patients carrying the lowexpression rs4149056 (minor allele frequency = 0.18) SNP had 51% (per allele) higher baseline E1S concentrations (n = 438, 95% CI (29%‐76%), p < 0.0001). After 3 months of AI treatment, 15% (58/378) of patients had detectable E1; carrying rs4149056 increased risk of maintaining detectable E1 by 84% (per allele) (odds ratio = 1.84, 95% CI (1.08‐3.14), p = 0.025). Conclusions: Patients carrying a low‐expression OATP1B1/SLCO1B1 SNP have higher pre‐treatment E1S and greater risk of maintaining detectable E1 during AI treatment, possibly due to replenishment from E1S reserves. Further studies are needed to assess whether this common SNP is associated with increased risk of AI treatment failure.

AB  -  BACKGROUND Giredestrant is a highly potent, nonsteroidal, oral selective estrogen receptor antagonist and degrader (SERD) that was found to be well tolerated and active as a monotherapy and in combination therapy in Phase i/ii studies in early BC and pretreated locally advanced/metastatic BC (LA/mBC). Dual HER2 blockade with pertuzumab + trastuzumab (PH) + a taxane (induction therapy) followed by maintenance PH is the first‐line standard of care for most patients (pts) with HER2+ LA/mBC. Despite HER2‐ER blockade synergy, paucity of Phase iii data evaluating maintenance PH + endocrine therapy (ET) vs. PH in pts with ER+/HER2+ LA/mBC leads to variable use of ET in this setting. Adding giredestrant to the maintenance phase could improve outcomes. TRiAL DESiGN This is a Phase iii, randomized, two‐arm, open‐label, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and safety of giredestrant + the fixed‐dose combination of PH for subcutaneous injection (PH FDC SC) vs. PH FDC SC after induction therapy with PH FDC SC + a taxane in pts with ER+/HER2+ LA/mBC. in the induction phase, pts will receive 4‐6 PH FDC SC cycles (1200 mg P/600 mg H in the first cycle, followed by 600/600 mg every 3 weeks) + a taxane (investigator choice of docetaxel/paclitaxel). Pts deriving clinical benefit may receive two additional cycles per investigator's discretion. Pts completing ≥4 induction therapy cycles, achieving at least stable disease, and with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥50% will be randomly assigned 1:1 to maintenance giredestrant 30 mg/day + PH FDC SC every 3 weeks or PH FDC SC only, until disease progression (PD). ET (aromatase inhibitor/tamoxifen) will be allowed in the PH FDC SConly arm. Study treatment will continue until PD, limiting toxicity, death, or consent withdrawal. ELiGiBiLiTY Enrolled pts must have ER+/HER2+ LA/mBC, disease‐free interval from completion of (neo)adjuvant non‐ET ≥6 months, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0/1, LVEF ≥50%, and adequate organ function. Pts with prior SERD treatment or presence of symptomatic central nervous system metastases will be excluded. All men and pre‐/perimenopausal women must be eligible for a luteinizing hormone‐releasing hormone agonist. AiMS The primary endpoint is investigator‐assessed, maintenance progression‐free survival. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS), objective response rate, duration of response, clinical benefit rate, ptreported outcomes, and safety. STATiSTiCAL METHODS The primary endpoint analysis will use a stratified log‐rank test at an overall 0.05 significance level (two‐sided). An interim OS analysis is planned, and an independent data monitoring committee will be in place. ACCRUAL The study is open for enrollment. Approximately 812 pts will be enrolled in the induction phase, to allow for approximately 730 pts to be randomized in the maintenance phase.

AB  -  BACKGROUND Endocrine therapies (ETs) that target estrogen receptor (ER) activity and/or estrogen synthesis are the mainstay of ER+ breast cancer (BC) treatment. Despite best management, ≤20% of patients (pts) with ER+/HER2‐ early BC (eBC) develop resistance (in some cases due to acquisition of tumor mutations in ESR1 that can drive estrogen‐independent transcription and proliferation) and still have high recurrence rates on standard ETs. New treatment alternatives for ER+/HER2‐ eBC are needed to reduce risk of recurrence and improve survival, tolerability, quality of life, and adherence. Giredestrant, a highly potent, nonsteroidal oral selective ER antagonist and degrader (SERD), achieves robust ER occupancy and is active against tumors that retain ER‐sensitivity or have ESR1 mutation(s). it has been demonstrated to be more potent in vitro and achieves higher ER occupancy in vivo than fulvestrant, the only currently approved SERD. Early‐phase clinical studies have demonstrated that single‐agent giredestrant (30 mg daily) has promising clinical and pharmacodynamic activity and is well tolerated in the ER+/HER2‐ eBC and metastatic BC settings. TRiAL DESiGN This is a phase iii, global, randomized, open‐label, multicenter study evaluating efficacy and safety of adjuvant giredestrant vs physician's choice of adjuvant ET (PCET) in pts with medium‐ and high‐risk stage i‐iii histologically confirmed ER+/HER2‐ eBC. Pts are randomized 1:1 to oral 30 mg daily giredestrant or PCET (tamoxifen, anastrozole, letrozole, or exemestane, given according to prescribing information). Stratification factors are risk (medium vs high, based on anatomic [tumor size, nodal status] and biologic features [grade, Ki67, gene signatures if available]); geographic region (US/Canada/Western Europe vs Asia‐Pacific vs rest of the world); prior chemotherapy (no vs yes); and menopausal status (pre‐/perimenopausal vs postmenopausal). Beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 1, pts will be treated with giredestrant or PCET for ≥5 years. Continuing PCET after 5 years is at discretion of the investigator and per local standard of care. ELiGiBiLiTY Female/male pts with medium‐/high‐risk stage i‐iii ER+/HER2‐ eBC; prior curative surgery; completion of (neo)adjuvant chemotherapy (if administered) and/or surgery < 12 months prior to enrollment; no prior ET (≤4 weeks of [neo]adjuvant ET is allowed). For men and pre‐/perimenopausal women, a luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone agonist will be given per local prescribing information (mandatory for pts in the giredestrant arm). AiMS Primary endpoint: invasive disease‐free survival (iDFS). Secondary endpoints: Overall survival; iDFS (STEEP definition, including second non‐primary BC); diseasefree survival; distant recurrence‐free survival; locoregional recurrence‐free interval; safety; pharmacokinetics; pt‐reported outcomes. in addition, this study aims to improve health equity in research and expand clinical trial access. The study will also use/develop digital healthcare solutions, which will enable better understanding of pts' needs and their adherence to ET.

AB  -  BACKGROUND Endocrine therapy (ET) modulates estrogen synthesis and/or estrogen receptor (ER) activity and is the mainstay of ER+ breast cancer (BC) treatment. ET + a cyclin‐dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor (CDK4/6i) is the standard of care in patients (pts) with ER+, HER2‐ metastatic BC (mBC) in the first‐line setting. Fulvestrant ± a CDK4/6i, and everolimus + exemestane, are the current regimens approved for use in the second‐line setting. However, therapeutic resistance to some ETs, such as aromatase inhibitors, can arise from ESR1 mutations driving estrogenindependent transcription and proliferation. Current post‐CDK4/6i treatment options are suboptimal. New therapy options are therefore needed to reduce this risk and to improve outcomes, tolerability, quality of life, and adherence to treatment. Giredestrant is a highly potent, nonsteroidal oral selective ER antagonist and degrader (SERD) that achieves robust ER occupancy and is active regardless of ESR1 mutation status. While phase i SERD combination data in the post CDK4/6 setting is encouraging, there is no randomized combination data. Combining giredestrant and everolimus may potentially improve outcomes after CDK4/6is and in pts with ESR1‐mutated tumors; evERA BC is investigating this combination to address the unmet need in the post‐CDK4/6i setting. TRiAL DESiGN This phase iii, global, randomized, open‐label, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of giredestrant + everolimus vs exemestane + everolimus in pts with ER+/HER2‐ locally advanced (LA)/mBC who had previous treatment with a CDK4/6i and ET in the LABC/mBC or adjuvant setting. Pts will be randomized to either giredestrant (30 mg) + everolimus (10 mg) by mouth (PO) every day (QD) on Days 1‐28 of each 28‐day cycle, or exemestane (25 mg) + everolimus (10 mg) PO QD on Days 1‐28 of each 28‐day cycle. Pts will receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Pts will use a dexamethasone mouth rinse four times QD for 8 weeks, started concurrently with study treatment. ELiGiBiLiTY Female/male pts ≥18 years with ER+/HER2‐ LA/mBC, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status of 0‐1, measurable disease defined per RECiST v.1.1 (or evaluable bone metastases with at least one predominantly lytic bone lesion confirmed by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging), disease progression ≥6 months after initiating ET + CDK4/6i in the LABC/mBC setting (and ≥4 months on most recent ET, if ET + a CDK4/6i was not the most recent therapy received), or relapsed either while taking or within 12 months of exposure to combination adjuvant ET (≥12 months) and a CDK4/6i (≥6 months). Availability of a baseline blood sample to determine ESR1 mutation status by circulating tumor DNA assay for testing at a central laboratory. Men and pre‐/perimenopausal women will receive a luteinizing hormone‐releasing hormone agonist on Day 1 of each 28‐day cycle. AiMS Primary endpoint: investigator‐assessed progression‐free survival (PFS; per RECiST v1.1). Secondary endpoints: investigator‐assessed PFS in pts with detectable ESR1‐ mutated tumors in circulating tumor DNA at baseline; overall survival; objective response rate; duration of response; clinical benefit rate; patient‐reported outcomes; safety; pharmacokinetics. STATiSTiCAL METHODS The primary endpoint analysis will use a stratified log‐rank test at an overall 0.05 significance level (two‐sided). An independent data monitoring committee will be in place for safety. ACCRUAL Target enrollment is 224 pts globally, and this study is currently recruiting.

AB  -  Therapeutic effect of tamoxifen (Tam) against ER+ breast cancer (BC) is known to be mediated by its binding to estrogen receptor‐alpha (ER /ESR1) and inhibiting estrogen signaling leading to altered gene expression. Besides this canonical mode of function, our pre‐clinical studies had revealed a novel mechanism wherein ESR1 directly binds wild type p53 (wt TP53) resulting in repression of its tumor suppressor functions, and Tam blocks this inactivation of TP53. Although patients with Luminal Tumors expressing wt TP53 are known to be more responsive to tamoxifen therapy, the underlying mechanism in tumors has remained unknown. To test the hypothesis that abrogation of the ESR1‐ mediated functional inactivation of TP53 is one of the major mechanisms that underlie the early effects of Tam therapy, we conducted a window of opportunity clinical trial in newly diagnosed luminal breast cancer patients undergoing surgical therapy. Methods: 59 women with ER+ invasive BC were randomized to 20mg Tam daily for 28 days prior to surgery or standard of care (SOC). TP53 status was confirmed by massively parallel sequencing. ER+ wt TP53 tumors were included in the study. IHC was performed on FFPE tissue from tumors to compare expression of ESR1 and TP53 along with their selected downstream targets. ESR1‐TP53 interaction in situ was determined by Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA).17β‐estradiol and Tam metabolites were measured in the plasma, tumor, and surrounding normal tissue using LC‐MS/MS. Global transcriptome analysis in tumors was conducted by RNA‐seq. Proteome expression in resected tumors was analyzed by reverse phase protein array (RPPA) with 216 proteins. Findings: Importantly, IHC on tumor tissues showed that the levels of ESR1 and TP53 were not altered in response to Tam therapy, whereas ESR1‐TP53 interaction was considerably disrupted by Tam (in situ PLA data). Differential gene expression (DGE) analysis using DESeq2 R package followed by GSEA pathway analysis showed that 307 genes were differentially expressed (p< 0.05) (log FC>1.5) in tumors from Tam‐treated versus untreated patients in response to Tam therapy. Pathways representing TP53 signaling, stem cells, and low‐grade luminal breast cancer were upregulated in the Tam treated group while those representing adipogenesis, invasive breast cancer, estradiol response, ras signaling, and E2F targets were downregulated. “Master Regulators” identified by iRegulon included several p53 targets. Integration of RNA‐seq and RPPA data revealed that DEGs fall into three categories: (i) regulated by TP53, (ii) regulated by ESR1, and (iii) regulated by both TP53 and ESR1. Together, the data demonstrated that in addition to its conventional effects mediated by its binding to ESR1 and inhibiting estrogen signaling leading to altered gene expression, Tam disrupted the ESR1‐TP53 interaction leading to functional reactivation of TP53 and reprogramming of gene expression. Conclusions: Our data 1) support ESR1‐TP53 crosstalk in tumors as a novel mechanism underlying endocrine therapy response of luminal BC patients, and 2) highlight the importance of factoring TP53 into therapeutic strategies for ER+ BC patients, and 3) have implications in stratifying ER+ BC patients to those who will or will not be responsive to Tam therapy.

AB  -  Background: Targeting the androgen receptor (AR) may be the next important endocrine therapy for advanced breast cancer. Enobosarm is an oral selective AR targeting agonist that activates the AR in breast cancer. Enobosarm has an extensive clinical experience in 25 clinical trials including in 2 phase 2 studies conducted in patients (pts) with AR+ ER+ HER2‐ metastatic breast cancer (MBC). An open‐label, parallel design phase 2 study, was conducted in 136 women with heavily pretreated ER+ HER2‐ MBC that were randomized to oral daily enobosarm at a dose of 9 or 18 mg. The primary endpoint of clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 24 weeks was 32% (9 mg) and 29% (18 mg). A post‐hoc AR expression subset analysis conducted in the ITT population with measurable disease at baseline revealed that the best overall response rate (ORR) was significantly higher in pts with ≥40% AR nuclei staining versus <40%, 34% and 2.7% respectively (p=0.0003) and the CBR at 24 weeks was significantly higher for ≥40% AR versus <40%, 52% and 14% respectively (p<0.0004). Overall, enobosarm was well tolerated with significant positive effects on quality‐of‐life measurements. Trial design: The ARTEST trial is an ongoing phase 3 multicenter, international, randomized, and open‐label study. Approximately, 210 pts with AR+ ER+ HER2‐ MBC and with AR nuclei staining ≥40% are being randomized 1:1 to either enobosarm 9 mg oral daily dose or an active comparator (physician’s choice of exemestane ± everolimus or SERM). Pts must have previously received a nonsteroidal AI inhibitor, fulvestrant, and a CDK 4/6 inhibitor for MBC and had a ≥ 6 months response to hormone therapy for MBC. The primary endpoint is imaging based progression free survival as measured by RECIST 1.1. The secondary endpoints on this study include the ORR, duration of response, overall survival, change from baseline in Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and change in EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC‐QLQ).

AB  -  OBJECTIVE: (‐)‐Epigallocatechin‐3‐gallate (EGCG) has preventive effects on obesity‐related precocious puberty, but its underlying mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to integrate metabolomics and network pharmacology to reveal the mechanism of EGCG in the prevention of obesity‐related precocious puberty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A high‐performance liquid chromatography‐electrospray ionization ion‐trap tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐ESI‐MS/MS) was used to analyze the impact of EGCG on serum metabolomics and associated metabolic pathways in a randomized controlled trial. Twelve weeks of EGCG capsules were given to obese girls in this trail. Additionally, the targets and pathways of EGCG in preventing obesity‐related precocious puberty network pharmacology were predicted using network pharmacology. Finally, the mechanism of EGCG prevention of obesity‐related precocious puberty was elucidated through integrated metabolomics and network pharmacology. RESULTS: Serum metabolomics screened 234 endogenous differential metabolites, and network pharmacology identified a total of 153 common targets. These metabolites and targets mainly enrichment pathways involving endocrine‐related pathways (estrogen signaling pathway, insulin resistance, and insulin secretion), and signal transduction (PI3K‐Akt, MAPK, and Jak‐STAT signaling pathways). The integrated metabolomics and network pharmacology indicated that AKT1, EGFR, ESR1, STAT3, IGF1, and MAPK1 may be key targets for EGCG in preventing obesity‐related precocious puberty. CONCLUSION: EGCG may contribute to preventing obesity‐related precocious puberty through targets such as AKT1, EGFR, ESR1, STAT3, IGF1, and MAPK1 and multiple signaling pathways, including the estrogen, PI3K‐Akt, MAPK, and Jak‐STAT pathways. This study provided a theoretical foundation for future research.

AB  -  Background: The visual evoked potential (VEP) is a form of an electrical signal. VEP originates from the visual cortex which is located in Brodman areas 17 and 18 of the occipital lobe. VEP is generated in response to stimulation of the retina by light flashes or pattern stimuli. The advent of VEPs in the 1970s first allowed clinicians to assess neural conduction in the optic nerve. There are many factors that affect VEP such as age and gender; one among them is the hormonal factor. Ovarian and thyroid hormones are vital factors in the generation of olfactory, taste, visual, and auditory neuronal activity. The ovarian hormones progesterone and estrogen play a major role in the conduction of the optic nerve. Aims and Objectives: The aims and objectives of the study are to evaluate the influence of ovarian hormones in the VEPs. Materials and Methods: Among the 1st year medical students, 26 young females (18–20 years of age) were randomly selected. Informed consent was obtained from them and the institutional ethical committee approved the study. Students having regular menstrual periods for the past 6 months with normal visual acuity were included. Those with a history of polycystic ovarian disease, having irregular periods, under hormonal treatment were excluded from the study. Detailed history helps in identifying the proliferative and secretory phases of the menstrual cycle. The P100 wave latency of VEPs was recorded during these two different phases. Results: An unpaired t‐test was used for analyzing the data. While comparing the proliferative and secretory phases, P100 wave latency was significantly reduced in the proliferative phase (101±3.6 vs. 97.9 ± 1.43 ms; P < 0.0001). Conclusion: The receptor sensitivity in the visual pathways to dopamine is increased by estrogen which in turn leads to a decrease in the time taken by the visual impulses to reach the visual cortex. Progesterone antagonizes estrogen activity in the central nervous system. Therefore, estrogen is responsible for the reduction in latency during the proliferative phase and progesterone is responsible for the prolonged VEP latency in the secretory phase. Thus, the excitability of the visual system is influenced by the ovarian hormones.

AB  -  Many natural substances were screened to develop nutraceuticals that reduce menopausal symptoms. A complex of Cirsium japonicum var. maackii and Thymus vulgaris extracts, named MS‐10, had significant positive effects. Under a low concentration of estrogen, which represents postmenopausal physiological conditions, MS‐10 had beneficial effects on estrogen receptor‐expressing MCF‐7 cells by reversibly enhancing estrogen activity. In addition, in the ovariectomized rat model, changes in bone‐specific alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcin, as well as low‐density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly decreased by MS‐10. These results show that MS‐10 protected bone health and reduced metabolic disturbances. Furthermore, in a clinical study, all menopausal symptoms, including hot flushes, parenthesis, insomnia, nervousness, melancholia, vertigo, fatigue, rheumatic pain, palpitations, formication, and headache, as well as colpoxerosis, were significantly improved by taking MS‐10 for 90 days. Therefore, the evidence supports that MS‐10 is an effective natural substance that can safely improve menopausal symptoms, including colpoxerosis.

AB  -  Purpose: This study compares immunohistochemical (IHC) versus molecular subtyping (BluePrint and MammaPrint) in the population of patients enrolled in MINDACT and outcome based on molecular subtyping (MS) versus surrogate pathological subtyping (PS) as defined by the 2013 St. Gallen guidelines. Methods: MS classified patients in the following subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER‐2‐, and Basal‐type. IHC/FISH for pathological subtyping (ER, PgR, HER‐2, and Ki67) was centrally assessed in the European Institute of Oncology (n = 5806). Hazard ratios for distant‐metastasis‐free survival (DMFS) by subtype were adjusted for chemotherapy and endocrine therapy administration and thus independent of adjuvant treatment allocation. Results: PS Luminal cancers classified as HER‐2+ or Basal‐type by MS did not have a significantly lower DMFS than the Luminal‐type cancers by MS (95.9%): HR = 1.40, 95% CI 0.75–2.60 (p = 0.294). More patients were identified with Luminal A disease by MS (63%) as compared with PS (47%) with comparable 5‐year DMFS (≥96.0%). Among the 500 patients with PS TN cancers, MS identified 24 (5%) patients as Luminal‐type with 5‐year DMFS estimated at 100% versus 71.4% for MS HER‐2+ or 90.1% for MS Basal‐type. Conclusions: MS was able to re‐stratify 54% of patients with a Luminal‐B PS subtype to a low‐risk Luminal A‐type group with comparable outcome. Among TN EBC, 5% were classified as Luminal by MS with Luminal‐like outcome. Molecular classification can help to identify a larger group of patients with low risk of recurrence compared with the more contemporarily used classification methodology including high‐quality assessed Ki67.

AB  -  Objective: To determinate the effect of oral hormone therapy [HT] on the degree of oxidative stress [OS] in postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome. Design: A randomized, double blind controlled trial was carried out. We evaluated 46 postmenopausal women without metabolic syndrome [WOMS] and 44 postmenopausal women with MS [WMS] that were assigned to treatment [Tx] (0.625 mg/d of synthetic conjugated estrogens [Sixdin®] plus 5 mg/10d of medroxiprogesterone [MPA]) or (Figure presented) placebo [P]. Then we conformed four groups: Group 1: 21 women WOMS in Tx; Group 2: 25 participants WMS in Tx; Group 3: 25 women WOMS in P; Group 4: 19 participants WMS in P. We measured lipoperoxides levels [LPO] by TBARS assay as OS biomarker. Tests were carried out at the beginning and at 6 months of treatment. An alternative cut‐off value of LPO ≥0.320 μmol/L was defined on the basis of the 90th percentile of young healthy subjects. Results: Of the participants enrolled, 4 of each assignation group dropped out in different time, leaving 21 subjects in group 1 and 2; 22 in group 3 and 18 in group 4, who completed all the assessments (basal and 6 mo.). At basal time, LPO levels were highest in the women WMS (0.356±0.06 vs. 0.318±0.06 μmol/L, p<0.01). The proportion of women with high LPO levels were also higher among the group WMS (73% vs 48%) p<0.05.After 6 months of treatment, LPO levels decreased significantly in groups 1 and 2: WOMS 0.310±0.05 to 0.260±0.04 μmol/L (p=0.001), and WMS 0.335±0.06 to 0.298±0.05 μmol/L (p<0.05). In placebo groups LPO did not change. We found that the proportion of women WMS with high LPO at baseline reduced 40% using HT (p<0.05); in group 1 the women with high LPO also diminished 18% and in P groups these proportions did not change after 6 mo. (Figure). Conclusion: Our findings suggest that oral HT decreases LPO as an OS biomarker, but this effect is proportionally higher in postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome than without metabolic syndrome.

AB  -  Background: Prostate cancer (PrCa) is one of the most common cancers among men and managed through surgery, hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, radiation, and cryotherapy. Depending on the stage of PrCa, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is commonly utilized as an intervention. ADT has proven effective in intervening in PrCa progression, although there are several side effects. Recently, the use of low carb diets has been shown to alter patients' metabolic phenotype and as such may reduce the side effects of ADT. Methods: In this study 35 men, who were beginning ADT, were randomized to low carb diet intervention with recommended exercise or control (no lifestyle change) for 6 months. Primary results have been reported showing significant weight loss at both 3‐month (17lb, p<0.01) and 6‐month (23 lbs, p<0.01) and improved insulin control at 3‐month (HOMA=‐19 as compared to baseline, p=0.02) but not at 6‐month (HOMA=‐4 as compared to baseline, p=0.13). For this exploratory analysis, sera collected at baseline, 3, and 6 months was used for metabolomics analysis utilizing GC/MS TOF, QqQ LC‐HILIC‐MS/MS, and TripleTOF 6600 LC‐RP‐MS and lipidomics analysis using TripleTOF 5600+ MS/MSALL workflows to quantify the chemical diversity of the metabolome and lipidome. Results: Over 450 metabolites and 1000 lipid species were quantified. Metabolomics analysis of sera from the control patients (ADT alone) demonstrated alterations in steroid biosynthesis, androgen/estrogen metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and lysine degradation. Lipidomics analysis of the control patients demonstrated changes in selective long chain polyunsaturated phosphatidylcholine species. Analysis of the ADT plus low carb patients revealed a change in pyruvate, glucose‐alanine cycle, selenoamino acid, phenylalanine/tyrosine, and taurine metabolism. Further, lipidomic analysis revealed changes in several triglycerides, plasmalenylethanolamine, and phosphatidic acid species. Conclusion: In summary, integration of metabolomic and lipidomic analysis in hormonal and metabolic interventions of PrCa patients revealed dynamic changes providing novel insight for tailoring therapeutic intervention and monitoring.

AB  -  The drug's activity at the target tissue could help to define the minimal effective dose to promote cancer preventive therapy. Here we present exemestane and sex hormone concentrations within breast tissue from a pre‐surgical study of alternative exemestane schedules. Postmenopausal women candidate for breast surgery for estrogen receptor‐positive breast cancer were randomized to exemestane 25 mg once daily (QD), 25 mg three times/week (TIW), or 25 mg per/week (QW) for 4‐6 weeks before surgery. Drug and sex hormones were analyzed from homogenized frozen tissue using a QTRAP 6500+ LC‐MS/MS System. Tissue drug concentrations were detectable only in the QD arm with higher concentrations in non‐malignant tissue. Estradiol was nearly suppressed in all groups in the non‐malignant tissue (QD vs TIW p = .364 and QD vs QW p = .693). In contrast, a dose‐response trend was observed in cancer tissue. Based on estradiol suppression in non‐malignant tissue, lower exemestane schedules should be explored for breast cancer preventive therapy.

AB  -  Polymorphisms of genes involved in estrogen synthesis have been linked to breast cancer risk, prognosis, and treatment response. We investigated the prognostic impact of a deletion spanning the entire UGT2B17 gene (UGT2B17*2) and genetic variants of the aromatase CYP19A1 and estrogen receptor α (ESR1) in 125 postmenopausal women with ER‐positive breast cancer enrolled in a randomized pre‐surgical trial. The UGT2B17*2 was estimated by copy number variation assays and the CYP19A1 rs10046/rs4646 and ESR1 rs2077647/rs2234693/rs9340799 by TaqMan allelic discrimination assays. Serum exemestane/17‐hydroxy exemestane were determined by MS and estrone (E1)/estradiol (E2)/ by GC‐MS/MS. The association of genetic polymorphisms with “any event” was assessed by the Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for confounders. The UGT2B17*2 was associated with higher levels of 17‐hydroxy exemestane (P = 0.04) and better prognosis (HR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.20–1.01; P = 0.05) compared with homozygote UGT2B17 wt. The CYP19A1 rs10046 A and rs4646 C alleles were associated with higher estrogen levels: rs10046 AA vs. AG/GG genotypes had median E1 of 35.9 vs. 27.4 pg/mL (P = 0.05) and E2 of 7.57 vs. 3.9 pg/mL (P < 0.004). After a median follow‐up of 7 years, women carrying the “low estrogen” alleles rs10046 G and rs4646 A had a better prognosis compared with homozygote wt for both polymorphisms (HR = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.17–0.93; P = 0.03). Our analysis points to an impact of UGT2B17 and CYP19A1 in postmenopausal endocrine responsive breast cancer. Carriers of UGT2B17*2 and CYP19A1 low estrogen variants may have better prognosis, supporting studies addressing the role of these polymorphisms in optimizing endocrine therapy.

AB  -  Background: Bisphenol A (BPA), a widely used chemical in plastics production, has been shown to have estrogenic activity, although it is unclear whether BPA exposure alters effectiveness of aromatase inhibitor (AI) treatment among women with breast cancer. In vitro studies have indicated that at higher concentrations (≥10‐4 μM), BPA inhibits aromatase expression and activity, whereas at environmentally relevant concentrations (≤10‐8 μM), BPA increases aromatase expression and activity. Few in vivo studies have investigated the association between BPA exposure and estrogen concentrations among non‐pregnant women. This pilot study among post‐menopausal women receiving AI therapy evaluated whether BPA is detectable in participants' urine, and the association between BPA and hormone concentrations. Methods: This study was ancillary to a larger intervention study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01509079), and participants provided informed consent for this ancillary study under a protocol approved by the institutional review boards of Park Nicollet Institute/HealthPartners and the University of Minnesota. AI adherence during the 4 weeks prior to the baseline visit was monitored through weekly diaries. Participants were instructed to collect spot urine collections in sterile, BPA‐free polypropylene containers in the 24 hours prior to the baseline study visit. Serum hormone concentrations were measured using serum collected at the baseline study visit. The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial ‐ Musculoskeletal Symptom (BCPT‐MS) scale was used to assess AI‐associated musculoskeletal syndrome symptoms at the baseline study visit. Results: Fourteen women agreed to participate in the pilot study, however one participant's data was excluded due to substances interfering with BPA measurement. BPA was detected in urine from all 13 remaining participants. Geometric mean urinary BPA concentration (1.55 mcg/g creatinine, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.98‐2.45) was higher than concentrations reported for females (1.36 mcg/g creatinine, 95% CI: 1.23‐1.51) in the 2013‐14 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey biomonitoring data. Age, body mass index, and percent body fat did not differ between women above or below the study median urinary BPA concentrations (1.49 ng/mL). Women with BPA concentrations >1.49 ng/mL had consistently lower serum estrone (5.0 vs. 7.0 pg/ mL, p=0.15), estradiol (2.8 vs. 3.6 pg/mL, p=0.04), and testosterone (21.5 vs 23.8 ng/dL, p=0.28) concentrations compared to women with lower BPA concentrations. No statistically significant differences in BCPT‐MS scores were observed between women with higher vs. lower urinary BPA concentrations. Conclusions: These preliminary findings suggest that BPA exposures may work in concert with AIs to lower serum estrogen levels. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings.

AB  -  BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Bothersome postmenopausal vaginal symptoms are prevalent and adversely affect quality of life and sexual activity. Although up to 40% of postmenopausal women have vaginal symptoms presumed to be related to low estrogen, limited evidence‐based information regarding the pathophysiology of symptoms exists. The MsFLASH Vaginal Health trial demonstrated no significant difference in improvement m vaginal symptoms between women randomized to 1) estradiol vaginal tablet (Vagifem®) + placebo gel or 2) hydrophilic moisturizing vaginal gel (Replens®) + placebo tablet versus placebo gel + placebo tablet. To better understand the primary results, we evaluated the impact of treatment on changes in the vaginal mucosal ecosystem. STUDY DESIGN: Double blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled trial with outcomes measured at baseline, 4 and 12 weeks. SITES: Seattle, WA; Minneapolis, MN. PARTICIPANTS: Women aged 50‐70 with ≥ 1 moderate to severe symptom of vulvovaginal itching, pain, irritation, dryness or pain with penetration; ≥ 2 years postmenopausal; no acute vaginitis or history of chronic vaginitis; no use of hormone therapy in the past 2 months; and no use of vaginal moisturizer or antibiotics in the past month. METHODS: Analyses included women enrolled m the trial who provided vaginal swabs and cervicovaginal lavage at all 3 time points. The vaginal microbiota was characterized by sequencing of the V3V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Mass‐spectrometry‐based untargeted metabolomics was used to detect 171 small molecule metabolites in vaginal fluid. Gram stained slides were scored according to Nugent criteria. 1) A subset of 75 women (25 in each arm) was randomly selected to examine kinetics of the vaginal ecosystem changes with the different treatments. 2) A subgroup analysis compared 60 randomly selected women with ≥ 2‐point decrease in most bothersome symptom (MBS) severity over 12 weeks to 60 randomly selected women with a ≤ 1‐point decrease in MBS severity‐over 12 weeks. The 2 groups were matched by treatment arm, age, race, study site, self‐reported MBS. 3) Among women with baseline microbiota data available we assessed correlations between Nugent score, Amsel criteria (pH, clue cells, vaginal discharge, amine odor) and the diversity and composition of the vaginal microbiota. RESULTS: We will present the following: 1) We compared the kinetics of the vaginal microbiota and the vaginal fluid metabolome between treatment arms to assess estrogenic effects over study time. We examined relationships between 12‐week changes in individual bacterial taxa and metabolites by treatment arm. 2) We compared bacterial diversity and the composition of the vaginal fluid metabolome between women whose symptoms did or did not improve, to better define whether there is a biological phenotype associated with the presence or absence of postmenopausal vaginal discomfort. 3) Among the 144 women with vaginal microbiota data at baseline, we compared the diversity of the vaginal microbiota between women whose Nugent scores were negative (0‐3), intermediate (4‐6), or BV positive (7‐10) and assess associations of individual taxa and individual Amsel criteria. CONCLUSIONS: Our results assess how the vaginal environment changes with treatments for postmenopausal vaginal discomfort, and whether changes m the vaginal ecosystem are a marker or cause of bothersome vaginal symptoms. Findings provide new insight into the pathophysiology of postmenopausal vaginal symptoms. Criteria for diagnosing postmenopausal BV is problematic as one of the 4 Amsel criteria, pH, is almost always elevated; new standards for an optimal vaginal ecosystem m postmenopausal women are needed.

AB  -  Consumption of dietary lignans has been associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases, although the underlying mechanisms are unclear. We sought to determine if urinary excretion of ENL, the predominant microbial metabolite of dietary lignans, was associated with plasma protein abundance using a cross‐sectional design based on data and plasma collected from 80 healthy participants in a randomized crossover, controlled feeding study. Proteomic analysis was performed on plasma samples collected at the end of each of two diet periods (160 samples total) using a customized antibody array corresponding to 2072 unique proteins. GC‐MS was used to measure ENL excretion in 24‐h urine samples collected in tandem with plasma. Linear mixed models tested the association between urinary enterolignan excretion and plasma protein abundance. Subsequently, over‐representation analysis was conducted considering 17 a priori pathways with putative associations with enterolignan bioactivity in an exploratory approach. Controlling the false discovery rate at 10%, ENL excretion was inversely associated with seven proteins (FCRL5, PSCA, GAB1, LAPTM5, CCS, REG4, CEACAM1), and positively associated with two proteins (WAS and FBLN5). Over‐representation analysis revealed associations of ENL excretion with estrogen and TNF signaling pathways, which were not significant after adjustment for false discovery. These ENL‐associated proteins and pathways have potential implications in cancer prevention.

AB  -  Introduction ‐ Women develop abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) five to ten years later than men (1,2). The delay in AAA development may be secondary to a protection from estrogens (3,4). The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of risk factors associated with AAA development in women, including postmenopausal hormone therapy. This has previously been investigated in small cohorts with limited information. Methods ‐ In a total cohort of 106,000 individuals from the Norwegian Nord‐Trøndelag Health Study (HUNT), 20,024 postmenopausal women were identified, of which 201 developed AAAs during a median follow‐up of 18 years (1995‐2014, i.e. 295,554 person‐years). The data is based on questionnaires, physical measurements, medical records and blood samples. A multivariable Cox regression model was constructed, where the final adjusted model included the following variables: smoking (current, past, never), body mass index, coronary heart disease, diabetes, hypertension and postmenopausal hormone therapy. Multiple imputation was performed for missing data (n=50 data sets). Serum estradiol concentrations were compared between women who later did or did not develop AAAs. Median time from blood sample collection to AAA diagnosis was seven years. Results ‐ Mean age at AAA diagnosis was 77 (59 ‐100) years. 28% of the cohort reported ever use of postmenopausal hormone therapy. In the multivariable analysis, a notable Hazard ratio (HR) of 0.58 was observed for current use of hormone therapy, but the result was not statistically significant (95% CI 0.29‐1.16, p=0.12). Women who reported current smoking had a more than ten‐fold risk for developing AAA during follow‐up (HR 10.9 (7.4‐16.1)). Positive associations were also found for hypertension (HR 2.0 (1.4‐3.0)) and coronary heart disease (HR 2.2 (1.6‐3.2)). There was no substantial difference in estradiol concentrations between women with and without AAA (p=0.06). Conclusion ‐ Postmenopausal hormone therapy is of less clinical importance compared to the strong associations observed between smoking, hypertension coronary heart disease and AAA development in women. These findings were supported by measured estradiol concentrations. References 1. Lo RC, Bensley RP, Hamdan AD, Wyers M, Adams JE, Schermerhorn ML.

AB  -  Background: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the aromatase enzyme (CYP19A1) and estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) may be associated with breast cancer susceptibility and endocrine‐mediated side effects. The IBCSG Tamoxifen (Tam) and Exemestane (Exe) Trial (TEXT) includes a translational research project to assess whether selected SNPs may influence treatment efficacy and toxicity. We report on early‐onset hot flashes and sweating (HF/S) and musculoskeletal symptoms (MS; myalgia, arthralgia, stiffness) with respect to CYP19A1 and ESR1 SNPs under combined endocrine therapy. Patients and Methods: 2,672 premenopausal women with HR+ early breast cancer were randomized to treatment with the GnRH‐agonist triptorelin (Trip)+Tam or Trip+Exe for 5 years. Randomization was stratified according to intended use of chemotherapy (yes/no) and lymph node status (N‐ vs N+). Estrogen‐depletion side effects (HF/S and MS) were recorded at baseline, 3‐monthly during the first year and 6‐monthly thereafter using the NCI CTCAE v3.0. DNA was centrally extracted from whole blood with Qiagen kits. SNPs of CYP19A1 (rs4646 and rs10046) and ESR1 (rs207764, rs2234693 and rs9340799) were analyzed by a pyrosequencing method (Diatech Pharmacogenetics S.r.l., Jesi, Italy). Control genotypes (wt/wt; wt/v; v/v) for all SNPs were processed in each run. Logistic regression was used to analyze two endpoints: presence or absence of grade (gr) 2‐3 HF/S during first 6 months and gr 2‐4 MS during first 12 months. Four genetic models were used to explore associations with side effects: genetic (wt/wt; wt/v; v/v), additive, dominant and recessive. Results: DNA was isolated and genotyped for 1970 (74%) consenting women. Clinical characteristics and outcomes of this cohort were consistent with the overall trial. At baseline median age was 44, median BMI 24 kg/m2 and 86% had regular menses. During follow‐up, 43% reported gr 2‐3 HF/S and 27% reported gr 2‐4 MS. The 5 SNPs did not deviate from Hardy‐Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.30) and minor allele frequency ranged from 29%‐48%. The CYP19A1 SNP rs10046 (C>T) was associated with gr 2‐3 HF/S. Specifically, women with variant homozygote genotype (T/T) had a reduced risk of HF/S (39% T/T vs 45%). The univariate odds ratio (OR) was 0.77 (95%CI: 0.62‐0.96; p=0.02) compared with other variant groups. The multivariate model showed consistent results after adjusting for age, BMI, menstrual status, chemo use, treatment allocation (Tam vs Exe) and baseline HF/S. The other 4 SNPs were not associated with the selected side effects. Conclusions: Our analysis indicates association of HF/S with CYP19A1 rs10046 genetic variants. The lack of association between early‐onset of selected estrogen‐depletion side effects and the other 4 SNPs may be masked by the concurrent Trip. Ovarian reserve before treatment may also influence the impact of SNP genotypes on early‐onset side effects. Further analysis with details of concurrent medications and treatment adherence will contribute to the interpretation of these results.

AB  -  Lignan intake, and its richest food source, flaxseed, have been associated with reduced breast cancer risk. Endogenous sex hormones, such as estrogens, play a role in breast cancer development, and lignans may alter these sex hormone levels. To assess the effect of flaxseed on circulating sex hormones, a randomized controlled trial was conducted among 99 postmenopausal women in Toronto, Canada. The intervention arm consumed 2 tablespoons (15 g) of ground flaxseed daily for 7 weeks; the control arm maintained usual diet. Baseline and week 7 concentrations of 14 serum sex hormones were measured using liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry (LC‐MS/MS) and immunoassay, and serum enterolignans (lignan biomarker) using LC‐MS/MS. Intervention effects on sex hormone levels were assessed using analysis of covariance. Serum enterolignans increased among the flaxseed arm (+516%). Women consuming flaxseed (vs. controls) had increased serum 2‐hydroxyestrone [treatment effect ratio (TER) = 1.54; 95% CI: 1.18‐2.00] and 2:16α‐hydroxyestrone ratio (TER =1.54; 95% CI: 1.15‐2.06); effects on other hormones were not statistically significant. Within the flaxseed arm, change in enterolignan level was positively correlated with changes in 2‐hydroxyestrone and 2:16α‐hydroxyestrone ratio, and negatively with prolactin. Findings suggest flaxseed affects certain circulating sex hormone levels with possible implications for future breast cancer prevention research.

AB  -  Objective: Postmenopausal (PM) women can experience bothersome symptoms including hot flashes/night sweats. Estrogen plus progestogen therapies (EPT) represent the current standard of care but can cause side effects including breast pain/tenderness and vaginal spotting/bleeding. The objective of this study was to assess the humanistic burden of menopausal symptoms and EPT side effects in a large sample of PM women in the US. Design: This was a multi‐center observational study with 352 PM women. The sample included: PMwomen taking EPT with side effects (side effects sample; n=202); PM women taking EPT without side effects (control sample; n=75); PM women not taking EPT with menopausal symptoms (untreated sample; n=75). The following Patient‐Reported Outcome (PRO) instruments were completed by all women at baseline: Breast Sensations Impact Questionnaire (BSIQ), Post‐Menopausal Bleeding Impact Questionnaire (PMBIQ), Menopause‐ Specific Quality of Life questionnaire (MENQOL) Menopause Rating Scale (MRS) and EuroQoL Five Dimension Five Level questionnaire (EQ‐5D‐ 5L). The Menopause Symptoms Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSTSQ) was completed by side effects and control samples only. Two electronic daily diaries (eDiaries), the Breast Pain and Tenderness Daily Diary (BPT‐DD) and Vaginal Bleeding and Spotting Daily Diary (VBS‐DD), were completed by the side effects sample daily for 28 days post baseline. Descriptive statistics (mean, SD) and repeated‐measures models were used to examine differences between various groups of participants. Results: Health status, as assessed by the EQ‐5D‐5L (possible score range: ‐0.109 to 1.000), was highest for the control sample who had no EPT side effects (0.93), followed by the side effects sample (0.85) and lowest for the untreated sample (0.84), with significant differences among the groups (p>0.001). In the side effects sample, average frequency of vaginal spotting/ bleeding, as measured by the VBS‐DD (possible score range: 0‐100%), was less than 30% across each seven‐day period; women aged 40‐50 years reported more frequent vaginal spotting/bleeding than older age groups with significant differences between the groups (mean percentage range: 19.7‐ 28.8% vs. 13.8‐17.6% [51‐60 years] and 4.4‐15.2% [≥61 years]; p>0.05). The side effects sample reported greater impacts from vaginal spotting/ bleeding on each domain of the PMBIQ compared to the control sample (p>0.001). Women aged ≥61 years reported lower impacts from vaginal spotting/ bleeding than younger participants, with significant differences between the age groups (1.2 [≥61 years] vs. 1.4 [40‐50 years] and 1.4 [51‐60 years]; with a possible score range of 1‐5; p>0.05). Mean scores of breast sensation severity, as measured by the BPT‐DD (possible score range 0‐10), ranged from 1.3‐1.5 across each seven‐day period with no significant differences between age groups. Impacts from breast sensations, as measured by BSIQ, were comparable among all groups, with no significant differences between samples or age groups. Severity of menopausal symptoms, as measured by the MRS, was significantly higher in the untreated sample compared to the side effects and control samples (p>0.001). Menopausal symptoms, as measured by the MENQOL, were higher in the untreated sample compared to the side effects and control samples, with statistically significant differences among the groups (p>0.001). The control sample reported significantly greater treatment satisfaction on each domain and total score of the MS‐TSQ compared to the side effects sample (p>0.001). Participants aged ≥61 years reported greater satisfaction on the MS‐TSQ 'administration' and 'tolerability' domains compared to younger participants, with significant differences among the three groups (p>0.05). Conclusion: Both menopausal symptoms and EPT side effects can be burdensome for women, impacting multiple domains of HRQoL. Findings highlight the need for effective hormone therapy without burdensome side effects.

AB  -  Background: Korean red ginseng (KRG) is a processed ginseng from raw ginseng to enhance safety, preservation and efficacy, known having beneficial effects on women's health due to its estrogen like function. While estrogen supplementation showed some modulation of endocrine disrupting chemicals, bisphenol A (BPA) has been focused as a potential endocrine disrupting chemical. In this study, we examined the efficacy and safety outcomes of KRG against BPA, focusing on female quality of life (QOL). Individual variations in susceptibility to KRG were also investigated with the Sasang Typology, the personalized medicine used for hundred years in Korea.Methods: We performed a single‐blind randomized clinical trial. Study subjects were young women (N = 22), consumed 2.7 g of KRG or placebo per day for 2 weeks and filled up questionnaires regarding gynecologic complaints at the 4 time spots. We analyzed urinary total BPA and malondialdehyde (MDA), an oxidative stress biomarker, with GC/MS and HPLC/UVD respectively, and diagnosed their Sasang Typology with the questionnaire for the Sasang constitution Classification (QSCC II).Results: KRG consumption decreased urinary BPA and MDA levels (ps < 0.05) and alleviated 'menstrual irregularity', 'menstrual pain', and 'constipation' (ps < 0.05). SoEum type (Lesser Yin person) among the Sasang types showed significant alleviation in insomnia, flushing, perspiration and appetite by KRG consumption, rather than other Sasang types. During the intervention, no one experienced any aggravated side effects.Conclusion: We suggest KRG is efficient for protection for female QOL and BPA‐ exposure and ‐ related oxidative stress. However, individual variation in susceptibility to KRG should be further considered for identifying ideal therapy.

AB  -  The oxysterol 27‐hydroxycholesterol (27‐OHC) is an endogenous selective estrogen receptor modulator implicated in breast cancer etiology. It is unknown whether circulating 27‐OHC is associated with colorectal neoplasia risk. Circulating 27‐OHC was measured using LC/MS in fasting plasma collected at baseline from participants of the Vitamin D/Calcium Polyp Prevention Study, a completed randomized clinical trial. Participants were between 45 and 75 years old, recently diagnosed with ?1 colorectal adenoma, and followed for new colorectal polyps during colonoscopic surveillance. Adjusted risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) of new colorectal polyps were estimated for quartiles of circulating 27‐OHC using log‐linear regression for repeated outcomes. Polyp phenotypes included any adenomas, advanced adenomas, hyperplastic polyps, and sessile serrated adenomas/polyps. Circulating 27‐OHC was measured at baseline for 1,246 participants. Compared with participants with circulating 27‐OHC below the first quartile (<138 ng/mL), those with circulating 27‐OHC at or above the fourth quartile (?201 ng/mL) had 24% higher risk of adenomas (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05‐1.47) and 89% higher risk of advanced adenomas (RR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.17‐3.06). Stronger associations were observed among participants with advanced adenomas at baseline. Circulating 27‐OHC was not associated with risk of hyperplastic polyps (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.66‐1.22) or sessile serrated adenomas/polyps (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.50‐2.07). Circulating 27‐OHC may be a risk factor for colorectal adenomas but not serrated polyps. Prevention Relevance: This study found that plasma concentration of 27‐hydroxycholesterol, a metabolite of cholesterol that regulates lipid metabolism and acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator, is associated with the risk of developing precursor lesions for colorectal cancer.

AB  -  INTERVENTION: Trade Name: METFORMINA TEVA Pharmaceutical Form: Coated tablet INN or Proposed INN: Metformin Concentration unit: mg milligram(s) Concentration type: equal Concentration number: 850‐ Pharmaceutical form of the placebo: Coated tablet Route of administration of the placebo: Oral use CONDITION: Breast cancer chemoprevention PRIMARY OUTCOME: Main Objective: The first aim of this application is to conduct a blinded, randomized, placebo controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the effect of metformin on breast cancer occurrence during a five year follow‐up. The study will be conducted on postmenopausal women, 45‐74 years of age. Besides age, women included in the study will be at high risk of breast cancer because of a waist circumference equal to or greater than (&#8805;) 80 centimeters (cm) and the presence of at least another component of metabolic syndrome (MS). Metformin is an antidiabetic drug widely given to patients with chronic conditions etiologically related to breast cancer (type 2 diabetes, elevated levels of androgens and estrogens, impaired glucose metabolism). The study hypothesis is that study participants treated with metformin will have a lower incidence of breast cancer in comparison with women given placebo on breast cancer prevention during a 5‐year follow‐up. Primary end point(s): Breast cancer incidence Secondary Objective: The second aim of this randomized clinical trial (RCT) focuses on the effect of metformin on the incidence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) including heart disease and stroke. Because CVDs are the leading cause of death in postmenopausal women and because breast cancer and cardiovascular diseases share several important risk factors, including type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose metabolism, the proposed study will target CVD prevention as the secondary aim. The study hypothesis is that study participants treated with metformin will show a lower incidence of cardiovascular diseases in comparison with women given placebo and healthy lifestyle information during a 5 year follow‐up. The third aim of this application is to develop a biorepository of blood samples, collected at three time points (before randomization, mid‐term, at the end of the study period). This will create a large biological database for future research INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1) Written Informed Consent; 2) Willingness to be randomized; 3) Postmenopausal status (defined as women with no menstrual period for at least 12 months before enrollment in the study); 4) Age 45 to 74; 5) Willingness to provide blood and urine samples; 6) Willingness and capability to be followed for five years; 7) Presence of central obesity, as defined based on a waist circumference ≥ than 80 cm, AND at least one metabolic syndrome component among those reported below: high plasma levels of glucose (≥100 mg/100 mL) high levels of triglycerides (≥150mg/100mL) or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality low levels of HDL cholesterol (<50 mg/100mL) or specific treatment for this lipid abnormality hypertension (Systolic Blood Pressure≥130 mm Hg or Diastolic Blood Pressure ≥85 mm Hg) or treatment of previously diagnosed hypertension Are the trial subjects under 18? no Number of subjects for this age range: F.1.2

AB  -  MS prevalence increases after the onset of menopause, because of estrogen deficiency. It is still not clear if menopause itself increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases in al women or only in those that develop MS. Many MS patients that show slight modification in cardiovascular and metabolic parameters are not generally pharmacologically treated since diabetes or alteration in the lipid profile are not evidenced. In this respect it is of importance to develop new therapeutic strategies to prevent and treat MS. Genistein (4,5,7‐trihydroxyisoflavone), shown a potentially preventive role on the cardiovascular apparatus in post‐menopausal women, may be termed as selective ER modulator (SERM), since it reveals both ER‐alpha full agonist and ER‐beta partial agonist activity. The investigators studied whether genistein may represent an efficacious and safe alternative for reducing vascular risk in postmenopausal women with metabolic syndrome. The clinical study was a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study involving 150 patients with metabolic syndrome. After a 4‐week stabilization on a standard fat‐reduced diet, participants were randomly assigned to receive either phytoestrogen genistein (54 mg/day) or placebo for 6 months. At baseline and following treatment fasting plasma glucose, insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA‐IR), lipid concentrations, plasma total homocysteine, leptin, adiponectin and visfatin were measured. Bioimpedentiometric and nutritional analysis, as well as a safety assessment of the endometrium and vagina were also performed.

AB  -  BACKGROUND: Vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats) are experienced by more than two‐thirds of women with breast cancer taking oral adjuvant endocrine therapy. Safe and effective treatments are lacking. Q‐122 is a novel, non‐hormonal compound that has shown promise for reducing vasomotor symptoms by modulation of oestrogen‐responsive neurons in the hypothalamus. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of Q‐122 in women with breast cancer taking oral adjuvant endocrine therapy and experiencing vasomotor symptoms. METHODS: We conducted a multicentre, randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, proof‐of‐concept, phase 2 trial at 18 sites in Australia, New Zealand, and the USA. Eligible participants were women, aged 18‐70 years, taking a stable dose of tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor following breast cancer and experiencing at least 50 self‐reported moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms per week. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) using an interactive web response system to oral Q‐122 100 mg or identical placebo, twice daily for 28 days. Randomisation was stratified by BMI (≤30 kg/m2 or >30 kg/m2) and use of any of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, gabapentin, or pregabalin. Q‐122 and placebo capsules were identical in appearance and containers identically labelled. During the double‐blind treatment and analysis phases, the participants, investigators, clinical research organisation staff, and sponsor were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome was the difference in the mean percentage change from baseline in the Vasomotor Symptom Severity Score of moderate and severe hot flushes and night sweats (msVMS‐SS) between Q‐122 and placebo after 28 days of treatment. Primary analysis was by modified intention‐to‐treat and safety was assessed in all participants receiving at least one dose of study drug. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03518138. FINDINGS: Between Oct 24, 2018, and Sept 9, 2020, 243 patients were screened, 131 of whom were randomly assigned and received treatment (Q‐122 n=65 and placebo n=66). Q‐122 resulted in a significantly greater mean percentage change in msVMS‐SS from baseline over 28 days of treatment compared with placebo (least squares mean: Q‐122 ‐39% [95% CI ‐46 to ‐31] vs placebo ‐26% [‐33 to ‐18]; p=0·018). Treatment‐emergent adverse events were generally mild to moderate and similar between the two groups (treatment‐related treatment‐emergent adverse events in 11 [17%] of 65 patients in the Q‐122 group vs nine [14%] of 66 in the placebo group); zero patients in the Q‐122 group and two (3%) patients in the placebo group had serious adverse events. INTERPRETATION: Q‐122 is an effective and well tolerated non‐hormonal oral treatment for vasomotor symptoms in women taking oral adjuvant endocrine therapy after breast cancer. Our results support the conduct of larger and longer studies of Q‐122, with potential use extending to postmenopausal women who require an alternative to menopausal hormone therapy.

AB  -  Background: Increasing evidence suggests the unique susceptibility of estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor negative (ERPR‐) breast cancer to dietary fat amount and type. Dietary n‐3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), may modulate breast adipose fatty acid profiles and downstream bioactive metabolites to counteract pro‐inflammatory, pro‐carcinogenic signaling in the mammary microenvironment. Objective: To determine effects of 1 to 5 g/d EPA+DHA over 12 months on breast adipose fatty acid and oxylipin profiles in women with ERPR(‐) breast cancer, a high‐risk molecular subtype. Methods: We conducted a 12‐month randomized controlled, double‐blind clinical trial of 5g/d vs 1g/d DHA+EPA supplementation in women within 5 years of completing standard therapy for ERPR(‐) breast cancer Stages 0‐III. Blood and breast adipose tissue specimens were collected every 3 months for biomarker analyses including fatty acids by gas chromatography, oxylipins by LC‐MS/MS, and DNA methylation by reduced‐representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS). Results: A total of 51 participants completed the 12‐month intervention. Study treatments were generally well‐tolerated. While both doses increased n‐3 PUFAs from baseline in breast adipose, erythrocytes, and plasma, the 5g/d supplement was more potent (n =51, p <0.001). The 5g/d dose also reduced plasma triglycerides from baseline (p =0.008). Breast adipose oxylipins at 0, 6, and 12 months showed dose‐dependent increases in unesterified and esterified DHA and EPA metabolites (n =28). Distinct DNA methylation patterns in adipose tissue after 12 months were identified, with effects unique to the 5g/d dose group (n =17). Conclusions: Over the course of 1 year, EPA+DHA dose‐dependently increased concentrations of these fatty acids and their derivative oxylipin metabolites, producing differential DNA methylation profiles of gene promoters involved in metabolism‐related pathways critical to ERPR(‐) breast cancer development and progression. These data provide evidence of both metabolic and epigenetic effects of n‐3 PUFAs in breast adipose tissue, elucidating novel mechanisms of action for high‐dose EPA+DHA‐mediated prevention of ERPR(‐) breast cancer.

KW  -  Temporomandibular Joint Dysfunction Syndrome
AB  -  The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is a ginglymoarthrodial joint, a term derived from ginglymus, meaning a hinge joint that allows only forward and backward movement in one plane, and arthrodia, a joint that allows gliding motion, and right and left TMJ are similar to knee articulation. It forms the ellipsoid variety of bicondylar articulation and synovial joints. TMJ movements are defined as elevation, depression, protrusion, retrusion, and lateralization. Primary muscle groups that reveal these joint movements m. masseter, m. temporalis, medial and lateral pterygoid, suprahyoid (digastricus, mylohyoid, geniohyoid, stylohyoid) and infrahyoid (thyrohyoid, sternohyoid, sternothyroid, omohyoid). The TMJ ligament complex consists of superficial and deep collateral ligament, sphenomandibular ligament and stylomandibular ligament. While the sensory nerves of the TMJ branch from the Trigeminal (V. Cranial nerve) nerve, they receive sympathetic innervation from the cervical ganglion (C8‐T3). Temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) is a broad clinical picture involving the TMJ and its disc, masticatory musculature, ligament tissue, and autonomic nervous system (ANS). TMD symptoms include decrease or excessive increase in joint range of motion (ROM), clicking sound or crepitation in the joint, pain around the joint or muscle group, chewing and swallowing problems. TMD is considered in two groups as articular and non‐articular disorders: articular disorders express the dislocation of the disc with and without reduction, while non‐articular disorders express the problems caused by myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). Pain caused by MPS, trigger point, fatigue, limitation of ROM, and ANS dysfunction cause TMD. With the inclusion of habits such as clenching and bruxism, pain, spasm and disability develop in the chewing muscles. Exposure to repetitive trauma and overuse of chewing muscles may cause the formation of tight bands and trigger points, which are characterized by MPS. ANS is part of the peripheral nervous system (PSS), which regulates involuntary physiological processes such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, and digestion, and is anatomically composed of 3 parts: the sympathetic, parasympathetic, and enteric nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) contain afferent and efferent pathways that provide sensory and motor stimulation, and these pathways consist of preganglionic neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and postganglionic neurons in the periphery. The SNS enables the body to handle stressors through the "fight or flight" response, and this reaction primarily regulates the blood vessels. The vessels are tonically innervated and in most cases an increase in sympathetic signals leads to vasoconstriction. SNS activation increases heart rate and contraction force. The PNS exits the SNS via cranial nerves III, VII, IX, and X, as well as via S2‐4 nerve roots. The vagus nerve (Cranial Nerve X), together with the sacral parasympathetic fibers, provides parasympathetic input to most of the thoracic and abdominal organs and has four cell bodies: Dorsal nucleus (parasympathetic stimulation of viscera), Nucleus ambiguous (preganglionic neurons innervating the heart), Nucleus solitarius (taste sense) and Trigeminal nucleus (outer ear circumference receives touch, pain and temperature information). The vagus nerve is responsible for the "resting and digesting" processes. By providing cardiac relaxation, the vagus nerve reduces contraction in the atria and ventricles and decreases the conduction velocity through the atrioventricular node. The vagus nerve also has a significant effect on the respiratory cycle, and its activity increases during expiration, constricting and stiffening the airways to prevent lung collapse. When the relationship between TMD and ANS was examined, it was observed that increased sympathetic activity and decreased parasympathetic activity were effective in the severity of TMD symptoms. It has been shown that TMD patients may show changes in the sympathoadrenal and inflammatory cytokine function resulting from their response to the stressor, and that the increase in the sympathetic activity of these patients in the long term may cause decreased interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) and norepinephrine response. It is thought that IL‐6 may be an important factor related to the increased morbidity and mortality in people with chronic stress and may play a pathogenic role in the course of stress‐reactive chronic diseases. Another mechanism thought to cause TMD is that the junctional region between the trigeminal subnucleus caudalis (Vc) and the upper cervical spinal cord, called the Vc/C1‐2 region, is the primary site for synaptic integration of sensory input from TMJ nociceptors, and Vc/C1‐ It is known that estrogen hormone is effective on the processing of nociceptive stimulus by neurons in region 2. Especially in the post‐menopausal period, the decrease in the level of estrogen in the blood causes an increase in sympathetic activity and causes pain and disability around the TMJ. Another method of evaluating the relationship between TMD and ANS is the measurement of heart rate variability (HRV). In a study, it was observed that HRV, which is a marker of ANS dysfunction, decreased in patients with myofascial temporomandibular disorder (TMD) compared to healthy individuals. Auricular vagus nerve stimulation is a peripheral, non‐pharmacological and non‐invasive neuromodulation technique that modifies signal processing in the CNS, activates reflex circuits, exploits brain plasticity for different therapeutic purposes, thereby affecting very different areas of the brain. Modulation of the afferent vagus nerve affects numerous physiological processes and bodily states associated with the transfer of information between the brain and the body. These include disease mitigating effects and sustainable therapeutic practices ranging from chronic pain diseases, neurodegenerative and metabolic disorders to inflammatory and cardiovascular diseases. Non‐invasive or transcutaneous Vagus Nerve Stimulation delivery systems provide stimulation in the auricular branch of the vagus nerve in the outer ear, thus eliminating the need for surgical implantation. One of the non‐invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulators in use today, NEMOS®, stimulates the outer ear turbinate and is European Conformity (CE) marked for the European Union for the management of epilepsy. The electrode is connected to a stimulation box and the stimulation intensity can be adjusted by the patient, caregiver, or treating healthcare professional. During use, it is increased in 0.1 milliamperes(mA) steps until the detection threshold of electrical stimulation is reached; the stimulation frequency was defined as 25 Hz. Another non‐invasive Vagus Nerve Stimulator gammaCore® is used for transcutaneous stimulation of the cervical branch of the vagus nerve and is FDA approved for the treatment of episodic cluster headache. The device generates a wave in the form of a pulse. It creates impulses with a 1 ms transition time of an electrical current with a frequency of 25 Hz. The recommended stimulation time is 2 minutes and can be applied up to 12 times a day.

AB  -  1. Objectives General objective To compare the surgical outcome between SSLF and modified USLS for apical fixation in women undergoing vaginal prolapse surgery Specific objectives 1) To compare the success rate of SSLF and modified USLS for apical fixation at 6 month and one year after vaginal prolapse surgery 2) To evaluate perioperative complications of the two procedures 3) To study the change in pelvic floor disorders symptoms in postoperative period ( 6 months and 12 months) among two groups. 2. Methods 2.1. Recruitment: Women with stage II or higher POP with involvement of apical compartment planned for surgical management will be included in the study. Detailed history will be taken regarding demographic profile like age, parity, menopausal status, mode of previous deliveries, history of smoking, heavy weight lifting. The presenting complaints as well as other associated complaints will be noted. History of previous abdominal or pelvic surgeries will be obtained. For recording the history regarding pelvic floor disorders, PFDI 20 (translated in Nepali language and pretested) will be used. General and systemic physical examination will be performed. The BMI will be noted. The prolapse will be examined and staged according to POP‐Q staging system. Cough stress test and ESST will be performed to rule out SUI. The tests will be performed after reducing the prolapse to rule out occult SUI. The intended prolapse surgery as well as necessary concomitant surgeries will be decided by the surgeon. Informed written consent will be obtained from the participants for including into the trial. 2.2. Randomization: The participants will be randomized on 1:1 basis to one of the methods of vaginal apical suspension either SSLF or USLS. Computer generated randomization table will be generated and used for randomization. The patients will be randomized by one of the residents posted in unit who is not involved in the research one day prior to surgery after pre‐operative examination and decision for surgery is made. 2.3 Surgical procedures The surgeries will be performed by a team of surgeons with technical competency in both the techniques. Method of Sacrospinous Ligament Fixation (SSLF): Women who are randomized to this group will undergo unilateral sacrospinous ligament fixation. For all the women with uterine descent requiring the hysterectomy, vaginal hysterectomy will be performed using standard method. In women with vault prolapse, the apex of the vagina is grasped with Allis forceps. A horizontal incision is given in the apex over previous scar of vaginal vault. The enterocele sac will be dissected off the vaginal mucosa. The sacrospinous ligament will be accessed via posterior approach. A vertical incision will be given in the posterior vaginal wall leaving 2‐3 cm bridge of vaginal mucosa between the incision and the vault. The right pararectal space will be entered by blunt dissection till the sacrospinous ligament is reached. The rectum will be mobilized medially. Once the ischial spine is identified, SSL is palpated by dorsal and medial movement of the fingers. Any fibroareolar tissue present over the ligament will be removed with the swab held in sponge holding forceps. Per rectal examination is performed to rule out rectal injury. For proper visualization of SSL, Breisky‐Navratil retractor will be used. A permanent suture Polyster no 1 will be passed through the SSL around 1.5 to 2 cm medial to the ischial spine under direct vision with the help of long needle holder. The other end of the suture is brought out to the right end of vaginal vault and it will be tagged. Another suture will be placed in SSL medial to the previous one and again brought out to the vault towards left end and will be tagged. Anterior repair if needed will be performed. The upper portion of posterior vaginal wall mucosa will be closed. The suspension sutures are then tied so that the vagina comes in contact with the SSL without the bridge of suture in between. Posterior colpoperinorrhaphy will then be performed. If anti‐incontinence procedures are needed, will also be performed. Method of Uterosacral Ligament Suspension (USLS) For all the women with uterine descent requiring the hysterectomy, vaginal hysterectomy will be performed using standard method. The pedicles of the uterosacral ligaments will be tagged. For women with vault prolapse, a horizontal incision will be given at the level of vault. It will be opened and the enterocele sac will be dissected off the vaginal mucosa. The enterocele sac will opened for the intraperitoneal access of uterosacral ligament. The posterior‐cul‐de‐sac will be packed with moist gauze. The remnants of the uterosacral ligaments will be identified medial to the ischial spine. A non‐absorbable suture; Polyster no 1 will be passed through the uterosacral ligament at the level of ischial spine. Another suture with the same suture material will be passed through the ligament around 1 cm below the ischial spine. The one end of the suture is passed through the anterior vaginal wall and the other end through the posterior vaginal wall. Same procedure will be repeated on the other side. Anterior colporrhaphy if needed will be performed. The suspension sutures will then be tied. Posterior colpoperineorrhaphy, anti‐incontinence procedure if needed will be performed thereafter. In case the allocated procedure cannot be performed for vault suspension, alternative surgery will be performed. If both the procedures cannot be performed, the procedure for apical suspension will be decided by the operating surgeon. During the surgery, duration of the surgery, intraoperative blood loss, occurrence of urinary or bowel injury will be noted. Cystoscopy will be performed after each surgery to rule out urinary tract injury. 2.4. Follow up After the surgery the patients will be managed in postoperative wards as per the hospital protocol. The duration of catheterization, post‐operative hospital stay will be recorded. All women will be taught and advised to perform pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) at the time of discharge. The postmenopausal women will be prescribed with local estrogen cream. Following the discharge women will be scheduled for follow up in 6 months and one year of surgery. However, if patient experiences any complications, she is advised to follow up immediately. The complication developed will be managed as needed and the event will be recorded. During each follow up, women will be enquired about the symptoms according to PFDI‐20, POP‐Q examination will be performed. 3. Measurement 3.1. Primary outcome Success rate of SSLF and USLS for apical suspension Success will be defined as absence of any of the following 1. Stage II or greater apical compartment prolapse 2. Awareness of bulge symptoms confirmed by affirmative response to question number 3 of PFDI‐20. 3. Need of additional treatment for prolapse (ring pessary, repeat surgery) 4.2. Secondary outcome Perioperative outcomes Duration of surgery Intraoperative blood loss Duration of catheterization Duration of Hospital stay 1. Complications Bladder, ureteric or bowel injury, neurological injury, vascular injury Urinary retention, Vault hematoma, Dyspareunia 2. Change in PFDI‐20 score The intraoperative blood loss will be calculated by the change in perioperative hematocrit concentration ( difference between pre‐operative hematocrit and hematocrit sent on first postoperative day) using the formula(25); Vloss total = BV X (Hctpreop ‐ Hctpostop) The blood volume will be calculated using the formula(26), BV= k1 x H3 + k2 x W + k3 For females, k1 = 0.3561, k2= 03308 and k3 = 0.1833 5. Adverse events Adverse event (AE) will be recorded as per Clavein Dindo classification of surgical complications which is as follows: Grades Definition Grade I Any deviation from the normal postoperative course without the need for pharmacological treatment or surgical, endoscopic and radiological interventions. Acceptable therapeutic regimens: drugs like antiemetics, antipyretics, analgesics, diuretics and electrolytes and physiotherapy. Also includes wound infections opened at the bedside. Grade II Requiring pharmacological treatment with drugs other than such allowed for grade I complications. Blood transfusions and total parenteral nutrition are also included. Grade III Requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention Grade III‐a: intervention not under general anesthesia Grade III‐b: intervention under general anesthesia Grade IV Life‐threatening complication (including CNS complications) requiring IC/ICU‐management Grade IV‐a: Single organ dysfunction (including dialysis) Grade IV‐b: Multi organ dysfunction Grade V Death of a patient Suffix 'd': If the patient suffers from a complication at the time of discharge, the suffix "d" (for 'disability') is added to the respective grade of complication. This label indicates the need for a follow‐up to fully evaluate the complication Any complications equal to or greater than grade III, will be labeled as Severe adverse events (SAEs). All SAEs will be managed as per the hospital protocol. Any such events will be reviewed thoroughly and the factor responsible for SAE will be identified so as to prevent them in future. 6. Statistical consideration Both descriptive and inferential statistics will be used. The outcome variables will be expressed as frequency and percentage for categorical variables, mean with standard deviation; median and interquartile range for continuous variables. The association between the categorical outcome variables will be sought using Chi square test. The comparison of difference in mean score between the same group will be performed by paired T test while the comparison of means between two different groups will be done by independent T test. 7. Data Management The data will be collected by the principal investigator. The validity and fidelity of the data will be periodically monitored by the DSMB. The data will be collected using preformed proforma and PFDI‐20. The collected data will be coded and entered in Ms Excel spreadsheet. The data will be then analyzed using SPSS version. The primary outcome will be analyzed according to original treatment assignment plan (Per protocol analysis). The success will also be analyzed according to intention to treat analysis.
